# GPS-Data-Analysis
## Overview
Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on a GPS dataset, completed during my research assistantship at UNC. This project aimed to uncover intricate patterns in GPS data, offering insights into user behavior and movement. Below is an overview of the tasks and methodologies I employed in this analysis.

## Project Tasks
### Task 1: Validation of Stays Around Fisherman Wharf
- Objective: Assess if the distribution of stays recorded by raw pings aligns with typical daily trip patterns.
- Methodology: Used **Optimal Hot Spot Analysis** in ArcGIS, focusing on Fisherman Wharf as a key area of interest.
- Outcome: Confirmed that mobility patterns align with expected daily trip patterns​​.
### Task 2: Validation of Match between Yelp and Veraset
- Objective: Evaluate the accuracy of scraped Yelp data and enhance the matching rate with Veraset POIs.
- Methodology: Matched Yelp data with Veraset visitations, analyzed unmatching rates, and adjusted matching standards based on industry characteristics.
- Outcome: Improved data accuracy by identifying and saving 6,662 accurate POIs from unmatched data​​.
### Task 3: Categories Analysis of Trip Chains
- Objective: Identify common service categories bundled together in the same trip.
- Methodology: Computed the relative possibility of visiting different categories and created heatmaps to visualize the data.
- Outcome: Produced heatmaps showing conditional rankings for top Yelp categories​​.
### Task 4: Sample Selection of Establishments
- Objective: Select a representative sample of establishments in Silicon Valley for comparison.
- Methodology: Compared data from Reference USA and Orbis databases, focusing on geographic precision.
- Outcome: Determined that Reference USA provided more precise geographic data​​.
### Task 5: Signal Pattern of Raw Pings
- Objective: Statistically describe the signal pattern to identify jumping points and verify Veraset accuracy.
- Methodology: Analyzed bivariate distributions, calculated the share of jumping moves, and examined how Veraset handles such data.
- Outcome: Gained insights into the accuracy of geohash levels for movement matching​​.
### Task 6: Signal Pattern of Work
- Objective: Explore different patterns of work-related visits.
- Methodology: Analyzed duration distributions for two types of work visits – those labeled by Veraset and those imputed based on visit duration.
- Outcome: Developed an understanding of visit patterns during work hours​​.
## Technologies and Tools
This project utilized a variety of tools including ArcGIS, BigQuery, and Stata, alongside programming languages like Python for data processing and analysis.
